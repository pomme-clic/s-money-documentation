## What are webhooks ?
A webhook enables Xpollens to push real-time notifications to your system. We use HTTPS to send these notifications to your system as a JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to orchestrate your own workflow, alert users and send notifications on your own.  

At Xpollens, we use webhooks to notify your application when an event happens. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a customerâ€™s bank confirms a payment, a customer has just been approved, a payment succeeds, or when something occuring on your customer accounts.  

See with your Xpollens representative to setup your webhook configuration and start receiving events.
