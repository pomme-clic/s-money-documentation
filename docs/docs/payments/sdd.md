# Mandate and SDD

## Sepa Direct Debit (SDD)

### What is SEPA Direct Debit?

SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) is a pull-based payment scheme that allows a creditor to debit a debtor's bank account. Similarly to other SEPA transfers, an SDD requires the IBAN (and occasionally the BIC) of both the sender and the recipient's bank accounts. However, it differs from other SEPA transfers in that the roles are reversed: the recipient of the funds is the one who must request the money transfer from the sender.  

SEPA Direct Debit is only available in Euros and can be used for both one-off transactions and recurring payments. It is often used for recurrent payments so that customers can avoid missing payments and being charged additional fees.  
The debtor must sign a valid SDD mandate to authorize the creditor to withdraw the money from the debtor's account. Additionally, there are other rules governing SDDs, such as pre-notifications, refunds, returns, etc.  

Xpollens provides a complete solution to create mandates and manage Sepa Direct Debit (SDD). You will be able to direct debit your customer with your SCI (Sepa Creditor ID).  
If needed, we can also provide if necessary a SCI within 48 hours.

There are two payment schemes under SDD:  

- SEPA Direct Debit Core scheme: available to both businesses and retail customers.
- SEPA Direct Debit Business to Business (B2B) scheme: available only to businesses.
