# Card LifeCycle

Welcome, if you are here it is because you want to launch a card program. First of all, to create your card program management, we define your card product with a first filter:
- funding source : Debit, Prepaid,...
- for who : Consumer, Business, Corporate ...
- what : Classic, Gold, Infinite

Then we decline it depending on the type of card you want : 
- physical or virtual card, 
- token (xPay) 
- wearable (keyring, bracelet..)

And at the end, we uses our card design simulator [Card Design Simulator](https://simulateur-carte.netlify.app/init/range), the packaging and the life cycle journey

## Order context

Here you are some ordering examples

### Order a physical card

<Image src="docs/Card_Order.png" alt="usecase 1"/>

#### endpoint ``` POST ``` /api/v2.0/card

```json
Create card data
{
"offerPartnerCode*": "string",  [Required] 
"holderExternalRef*": "string", [Required] 
"cardExternalRef*": "string",   [Required]  Constraints: Max 50 chars 
"visualCodeSelected": "string"┃null,        Constraints: Max 10 chars
"label": "string"┃null,                     Constraints: Max 50 chars 
"wishPin": "boolean"┃null, 
"isNfcActivated": "boolean"┃null, 

}
```

> - ``` offerPartnerCode ``` : The Partner's offer code provided by Xpollens. 
> - ``` holderExternalRef ``` : The user/holder's reference attributed by the partner (holderExternalRef = appUserId).
> - ``` cardExternalRef ``` : The card's reference attributed by the partner
> - ``` visualCodeSelected ``` : The partner can define one or several visual codes for the same offer (same product). If the attribute is not entered when ordering the card, then the visual code defined by default in the offer will be selected for the card.
>  - ``` label ``` : The name or partner's reference of the card.
>  - ``` wishPin ``` : The Partner can choose to create the card with or without wishpin (If the partner 's offer doesn't support it, then the PIN will be randomly generated). If the attribute is not entered when ordering the card, and defined by default in the offer, then the card will be created with a pin chosen by the holder.
> - ``` isNfcActivated ```  : The Partner can choose to create the card with or without NFC (If its' by default deactivated in the offer, then the card will be created without NFC).If the attribute is not entered when ordering the card, and activated by default in the offer, then the NFC will be activated for the card.

### Wish PIN

In this PIN Definition scenario, a token and signature must be generated by a customer back-end and provided to wishPIN's SDK. The signature will act as a proof of authentication. Because the signature generation requires the use of the RSA private key it must be generated by a back-end and not inside the app.
We also recommend to generate the token in the back-end computing the signature and not in the mobile application, to avoid timestamp issue due to mobile with incorrect time. In addition, because Bank's Compliance doesn’t allow Smartphones to send the PIN (even ciphered) to the PINDefinition backend the PIN format send by the mobile must be the position in the keypad coordinates table shared by Manufacturer’s PINDefinition back-end.
Example: keypad coordinates [9,5,1,3,5,7,4,0,8,6,2] shared by back-end and PIN selected by cardholder 1234.
Coordinates provided to Card Companion SDK must be 2936 – index in the table -).

 Remember you have 2 choices : Random PIN (by default, no need to implement anything) or Wish PIN in order to allow to your end user to define his own PIN code.

 WishPIN is <b class="term">only possible for mobile app</b>. <b class="term">You have to add our sdk in addition with a TokenCB signature API</b>

### Order a virtual card

Order a virtual uses the same API to create a card (physical or virtual). Change is your offer.
