# Overview

The Xpollens API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Xpollens API in a dedicated sandbox mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the banking networks.
See with your Xpollens representative to gain access to your dedicated Sandbox and API keys.

## Service Blueprint

Most of presented use cases are illustrated by a service blueprint. It gives an overview of what a feature does and illustrates the function of several APIs.
The goal is to present developers and product teams an understanding of what the APIs can offer and how our platform can be integrated with your use cases.
