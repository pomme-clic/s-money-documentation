# Authentication 

Authentication is required for your end-customers if you are on the Retail B2C market ; it is also required for all key individuals of your professional customers, if you are on the Corporates B2B market.

If you do not have your own mobile application, we can provide one for you : Xpollens Authenticator. This app will handle both the identification process during KYC, and the strong authentication of any sensitive operation or online purchase that will occur on your customer's account.
