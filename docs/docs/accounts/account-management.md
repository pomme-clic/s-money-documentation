## What does IBAN means ?

The IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is the unique identifier of the User Account.  
The IBAN uniquely identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country. 
IBAN is the ISO 13616 international standard for numbering bank accounts.
Many information on IBAN from European Central Bank can be found here :

Once a user is created, an account can be created and will be attributed with an IBAN .
