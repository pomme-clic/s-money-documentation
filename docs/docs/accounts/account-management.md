# Account management 

## What does IBAN mean ?

The IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is the unique identifier of an User Account.  
The IBAN uniquely identifies an individual account, at a specific financial institution, in a particular country. 
IBAN is the ISO 13616 international standard for numbering bank accounts.
Many information on IBAN from European Central Bank can be found here : 
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/iban/html/index.en.html


Once a user is created, an account can be created and will be attributed with an IBAN .
