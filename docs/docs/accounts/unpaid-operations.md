## Client Debt

<Highlight>

In some case of transaction, the account balance might not be sufficiant, for example when an offline Card transaction or a Payin contestation (money might be spent..).
We propose a unpaid mechanism to ensure payment of this kind of operation.

<Image src="docs/Debt.png" alt="usecase 1"/>

<Highlight type="tip">

The mechanism is based on automated P2P that create debt on the customer account and  ability for Client to recover the money.

</Highlight>


<Highlight type="danger">

Even if it is rare case, you, as client, will have to cover and recover your client debt. But do not worry all the necessay API are available.
