# Additional information 
## Workflow change 

During user onboarding it is  possible for the user to switch from the `Electronic_Signature` workflow to the `Identity` workflow (one way only, it is not possible to switch from `Identity` to `Electronic_Signature`).
This is possible as long as the user has not completed the Selfie+ID step in the `Electronic_Signature` workflow.
To handle the switch of workflow, partner should call the `PUT /api/v3.0/users/{appUserId}/kyc/demand` by specifying the new workflow in the payload.

> Exemple
> ```json
> PATCH /api/v3.0/users/{appUserId}/kyc/demand
> {
>	 "workflowCode" : "Identity"
> }
> ```
