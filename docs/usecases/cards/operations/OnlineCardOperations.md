## Online Authorisation - State diagram & balance

### State diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
 state fork_state <<fork>>
      [*] --> fork_state: Authorization request
      fork_state --> Approved: Authorization created
      fork_state --> Rejected: Authorization failed
	  Approved --> Reversed : Partial recovery
    Approved --> Canceled : Total recovery
    Approved--> Expired : After 10 days (or 21 for withdrawal) 

```

<br/><br/>

* * *

## Authorisation context

The context of card usage is provided in field `context` .  
Depending on this context, the `method` varies to provide even more details about the operation conducted.

The `merchantName` should be displayed in the cardholder's mobile application to provide them with details about their transaction history.

The `tokenRequestorId` is filled in only if the payment has been made with a tokenized card.

The `merchantCategoryCode` will always be set. It is based on ISO 18245 (https://www.iso.org/fr/standard/79450.html)

Payments made abroad are characterized by:

- `localAmount` is not null and contains details about the currency and the value
- `conversionRate` explains how the `amount` is calculated from the `localAmount`

<br/><br/>

* * *

## Authorisation failed

An authorization can fail for various reasons stemming from the card, the account, the transaction conducted, etc.  
In case of authorization refusal, use the `rejectReason` to provide information to your cardholder.

| rejectReason |

| AccountLimitsExceeded |
| AccountStatus |
| ActivationDeclined |
| ActivationDeclinedCapture |
| BlockedCard |

## Card Authorization expiration

The card authorization -if not settled- will expire after 10 days in most cases.  
Some card authorization for specific MCC (hotels, car rent, ..) can last up to 31 days before they expire if no capture is performed on operation.
Withdrawals expire after 21 days.

                Xpollens SAE -->> Partner: Callback <br/>  CardOperationCreatedOrUpdated {status=Expired}
end 
```

In some rather rare cases, settlements may occur belatedly, after the regulatory delay of 10 and 31 days. In these instances, the authorization expires, and the compensation will be created as an offline operation.

## FAQ about card authorisation

### FAQ1 - Card information request

A card information request (wallet card tokenisation, card on file) will not trigger the callback #CardOperationCreatedOrUpdated, but a callback #25.

### FAQ2 - `merchantType`

The `merchantType` will always be settled (can't be `null`) in the callback CardOperationCreatedOrUpdated response body.  
It matches the MCC (Merchant Category Code) of the merchant based on ISO 18245 (https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-merchant-data-standards-manual.pdf)

### FAQ3 - One payment but multiple settlement

On marketplaces, one authorisation can lead to several settlements.  
For example  
I am on marketplace A,  
I have a basket of 3 items from 3 different merchants,  
when I pay, I only receive one payment authorisation.  
However, 3 transactions are carried out at the 3 merchants.  
So 3 compensations will be issued by the 3 banks of my merchants.  
In this case, the first clearing will match the authorisation. The other two clearing will created offline operations.
