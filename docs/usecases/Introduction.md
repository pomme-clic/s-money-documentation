# Introduction
This section of the documentation aims to present end-to-end integration cases using the XPollens APIs to facilitate the understanding of XPollens APIs use cases.

It will notably include detailed use cases of the APIs, additional information on API usage (non-passing cases, error message handling, etc.), concrete examples of end-to-end API calls for the implementation of a use case, FAQs that will be continuously updated, and more.

This section will be regularly enriched with practical feedback from all XPollens partners to be as relevant and concrete as possible.
